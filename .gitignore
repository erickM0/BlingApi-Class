# Google Apps Script (CLASP specific)
# You generally *want* to commit .clasp.json as it contains your project ID.
# However, if it ever contains sensitive info (e.g., service account private keys),
# you might consider ignoring it and managing those details differently.
# For most Apps Script CLASP projects, committing .clasp.json is fine.
